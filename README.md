# Redis-Demo

- This repository contains a few examples of using **Redis** in a **Spring Boot** project.
- Redis is an in-memory key-value data store which can be used as a database, cache, streaming engine or message broker.
- The examples make use of **Spring Data Redis** as Spring Data Redis makes it very easy to interact with Redis.
